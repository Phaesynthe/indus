# Industrialist Gameplay Brainstorming


Character Archetypes - Players could choose a starting origin that determines what their initial options are.
* Rags to Riches / The Orphan
* The Rich Tycoon
* The Genius / Innovator


Would players choose real time-periods and cities?

Players will have capital that can be invested in businesses. They gain more capital through the profitability of those businesses, selling off assets, getting bank loans, or seeking investors.

Players can also seek out investors. Reputation, relationship, and salesmanship would play some important part here. Obviously, investors would gain an interest/share of the company and would expect something in return.

## Business management

### Micromanagement
How much micromanagement might be possible?
  What micromanaged gameplay might look like:
    The player would be able to see each individual location of a business in detail. There would be employees, products/services, supplies, pricing, customer traffic and demographics, nearby rivals... ?

Micromanagement might be an integral part of early gameplay, with the ability to hire managers or foremen who would take over the smaller details later on. Obviously this would require some sort of AI. The managers could either have settings as to how they are expected to respond to situations, or personalities that influence their decision making. A combination of the two could also work.
This system could be a precursor to the Incarnations shopkeeper systems.
