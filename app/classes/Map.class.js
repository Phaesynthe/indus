/* global Map */

/**
 * The map will be a collection of mounted shapes that serve as buildings and paths.
 *
 * But are the paths actually needed?
 *
 * The thinking has been that aspects would need to travel along lines as a means of exposing surrounding
 * areas to that point's aspects. This may not be the case.
 *
 * In reality, people move along lines. The lines transport people nearer or further from their point or origin.
 * This can be mapped as a shape with points at on the lines that are projected from the origin.
